How to Install
Start by setting up your PostgreSQL server by copying DB.sql into the query editor in pgAdmin.
Modify ConnectionDB.java located in /src/main/java/com/demo/ConnectionDB.java according to your databases settings
We assume you have apache tomcat installed, if not, install it
Add the apache tomcat plugin into the project via settings → plugins → search for smart tomcat and download
Add a new configuration for apache tomcat by going to Edit configuration → + symbol → smart tomcat → configure → add the directory path to where apache tomcat was installed → save the changes
Now that apache tomcat is configured, make sure it is selected and then click the run button and open the link that appears after everything compiles. This is our database website.

DDLs
The only DDL required is the file titled DB.sql located in /sql/DB.sql.
